/**
 * This package provides the fundamental compatibility elements for bootstrapping an Android application using
 * homunculus. It does not incorporate further comfort classes, helpers or components, which can be found in
 * the android.component package. Indeed these classes will never be a requirement to use the
 * at all, it just makes the setup easier.
 * <p>
 * Direct dependencies should be avoided, when possible, to lower hard dependencies on the
 * infrastructure (like forcing the usage of a specific application or activity class. See also
 * the android.core package.
