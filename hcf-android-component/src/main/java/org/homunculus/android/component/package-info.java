/**
 * This package contains a growing amount of components, which are intended to be used in the context of homunculus,
 * however their usage and dependencies are not necessarily attached to the framework per se. So you can find
 * a random number of components which may be used without the context of the container at all, or which only
 * provides additional functionalities when used in the context of a container.
 * <p>
 * There is also a subset of components which are only suited in a special context and under certain conditions, but
 * makes it's usage easier for that case (other than an existing API).
